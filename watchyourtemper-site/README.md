# WATCHYOURTEMPER

**Your rage is sacred. Let it speak.**

This is the official interactive website for [WatchYourTemper](https://www.instagram.com/watchyourtemper), a mythic post-club/industrial electronic project exploring emotional repression, psycho-horror, and sacred catharsis. The site serves as both a cinematic landing portal and a fractured digital altar.

---

## 🕳 Overview

Built as a **React + Vite single-page application**, this interface merges:

- Cinematic background video loops
- Ambient scanlines, corruption FX, and digital decay
- A ritualistic UI for streaming platform selection
- Mailing list integration (the Inner Circle)

It prioritizes **immersive continuity**, keeping audio, visuals, and interaction coherent across the entire experience.

## 🧟‍♀️ Design Philosophy

This site is not a product — it’s a **ritual**.

No unnecessary hover states. No rounded corners. No algorithm-chasing fluff.

Instead, it leans into:

* **Corruption** over clarity
* **Silence** over spectacle
* **Feeling** over functionality

---

## 🩸 Inner Circle

This site links to a private supporters' mailing list through [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/), where listeners receive exclusive content, Bandcamp codes, and early access to rituals.

---

## 📦 Deployment

Recommended: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the `dist/` folder to your static host of choice.
